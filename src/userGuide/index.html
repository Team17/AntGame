		<h1>AntGameSimulator: Getting Started Guide</h1>




		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Welcome! We're glad you're here, We've been waiting for you.
			Spend a few minutes going through this guide to learn some
			AntGameSimulator basics. We will introduce you to a number of useful
			tutorials, such as how to use the simulator and how to make your own ant
			brain to battle the legendary ant brains.</p>

		<h3>Basics</h3>
		<p>
			The simulator comes with several files, in the<span class="highlight">
				brains</span> and <span class="highlight">world</span> directories you will
			find some examples of the brains and world files. In the extra folder
			you will find two files to aid you in creation of ant brains and
			maps, which are covered in later sections. To lauch the simulator
			open the<span class="highlight"> antgame.jar </span> file.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's get started, first launch the simulator. You should have a
			window open as shown below. <br>
			<img src="img/main_menu.jpg" class="screenshots">
		</p>


		<p>Here we have our main menu, on top there are three buttons,
			Help, Tournament and Random Map. Functions of each is covered in the
			next section.</p>
		<p>
			In the middle section, you can see two hexagons, one for the Red team
			and one for the Black team. In the middle of each hexagon are
			buttons to select brains for the team. Once you press the select
			brain button a file picker will launch, pick any file and see what
			happens. If you picked a non-ant brain file, the button becomes red,
			indicating the file does not meet the standard ant brain format. If
			it is an acceptable format the button will become green. You can see
			examples of both cases in the screenshot below: <br>
			<img src="img/buttons.jpg" class="screenshots"> Now try
			selecting a valid ant brain (Hint: You can find one in the brains
			folder provided with the game).
		</p>

		<p>
			In the bottom section, there are two buttons, Select Map and Start.
			Select Map button works in a similar manner as the select brains
			buttons, it becomes green with the correctly formated map, red with an invalid
			map. The start button can be activated only when there is a valid
			map and two valid ant brains. Only then does the button becomes green
			allowing you to start the simulator. Try inserting two valid brains
			and a valid map and press start to see the simulation. The screenshot
			below shows how your main menu should look if you input all
			valid files. <br>
			<img src="img/ready.jpg" class="screenshots">
		</p>

		<h3>The Simulation</h3>

		<p>

			Once you press start, another window will pop up with the simulation.
			To pan around the map left click and move your mouse. To zoom in use
			your mouse wheel, alternatively you can use right button of the mouse
			(Warning, very sensitive zooming with the mouse). You can also resize
			the window to increase your view of the world. <img
				src="img/simulator.jpg" class="screenshots">
				
			<br> The green hexagons represent food cells, black hexagons with lines inside are black ants.
			Red ants are the dark red hexagons with lines inside. The ant hills are pale version of ant 
			heaxgons. Rocks are represented as a beveled hexagon.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are only two controllers in the simulator view, on the left
			corner. Firstly we have a Speed slider, which lets the user control the
			frame rate of the simulation, the maximum speed depends on the
			hardware in use. Try dragging it to the right, did you notice how
			much faster everything started moving? End game button, stops the
			current simulation and processes the rest of the simulation without
			visualisation. This drastically reduces waiting time for the result
			of the simulation. You can not do anything to the window during this
			process, please wait for the result. Once the simulation is done
			processing, you will see a results window as shown below. <img
				src="img/result.jpg" class="screenshots">
		</p>

		<h3>Random Map</h3>

		<p>
			The random map feature allows the user to create a map on the fly without
			needing to create and load a map. Every random map is generated in a
			manner which fulfils all the map requirements, such as number of
			food particles per cell and ant hill size (details are covered in the
			Making a Map Section). <br> <br> To generate a map simply
			press the Random Map button, when a successful map is created it will
			become green. If you change your mind, you can still select a map
			file. The screenshot below shows how the screen will look when a map is
			generated. <img src="img/random.jpg" class="screenshots">
		</p>

		<h3>Tournaments</h3>

		<p>
			The tournament mode allows you to pit an arbitrary number of brains
			against each other. You need at least three ant brains in order to
			create a tournament. <br> <br> To create a tournament,
			simply press the Tournament button in the main menu. A new window
			will pop up as shown below. <img src="img/tourna.jpg"
				class="screenshots"> The Tournament menu works in similar
			fashion as the main menu. To add a brain, first select a brain, if it
			is a valid brain, the button will become green. Then you can add the
			brain to the list of brains in the tournament by pressing the add
			brain. Remember, you need at least 3 ant brains. <br>
			<br> Selecting the map works in exactly the same way as it does
			in the main menu. You can pick one yourself or generate a random map.
			<br>
			<br> Once three ant brains or more are added to the list, and a
			map is selected/generated the start button will become green and
			allow you to start the tournament.
		</p>
		<p>During the tournament, each pair of submissions is pitted
			against each other twice, once with the first submission playing red
			and the second black, and once with the first playing black and the
			second red. A submission gains 2 points for each game it wins, and 1
			point for each draw. The submission with the most points wins the
			tournament. If there is no clear winner, the tournament
			is repeated with a certain number of finalist submissions.</p>

		<h3>Ant Brain:</h3>
		<h4>Ant Brain Rules:</h4>
		<p>Every ant brain has to follow a specific file format. The
			concrete format of these files are as follows:</p>
		<div class="list">
			<ul>
				<li>Each line in the file represents one state. The first line
					is state 0, the second line state 1, and so on.</li>
				<li>The file may contain no more than 10000 lines. (It may
					contain fewer.)</li>
				<li>Each line consists of a sequence of whitespace-separated
					tokens, followed (optionally) by a comment beginning with a
					semicolon and extending to the end of the line.</li>
				<li>Tokens are either keywords or integers. Keywords are
					case-insensitive.</li>
			</ul>
			The possible tokens for instructions are:
			<ul>
				<li>Sense</li>
				<li>Mark</li>
				<li>Unmark</li>
				<li>PickUp</li>
				<li>Drop</li>
				<li>Turn</li>
				<li>Move</li>
				<li>Flip</li>
			</ul>

			The tokens for sensing directions are:
			<ul>
				<li>Here</li>
				<li>Ahead</li>
				<li>LeftAhead</li>
				<li>RightAhead</li>
			</ul>

			The tokens for conditions are:
			<ul>
				<li>Friend</li>
				<li>Foe</li>
				<li>FriendWithFood</li>
				<li>FoeWithFood</li>
				<li>Food</li>
				<li>Rock</li>
				<li>Marker</li>
				<li>FoeMarker</li>
				<li>Home</li>
				<li>FoeHome</li>
			</ul>
			The tokens for arguments to turn are:
			<ul>
				<li>Left</li>
				<li>Right</li>
			</ul>

		</div>

		<h4>
			The 8 Insturctions
			</h3>
			<p>There are a total of 8 types of instructions and here is their
				breakdown:</p>
			<p>
				<span class="command">Sense sensedir st1 st2 cond </span><br>
				Go to state st1 if condition cond in direction sensedir is true,
				else go to state st2. As previously stated, you can sense 4
				directions, here, ahead, left ahead and right ahead. For a full list
				of conditions, refer to the previous section.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="command">Mark x st </span><br> Set mark x in the
				current cell, and go to the state st. Every team has 6 markers.
				Therefore x can be 0,1,2,3,4,5.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="command">Unmark x st</span><br> Clear mark x in
				the current cell, and go to the state st.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="command">PickUp st1 st2 </span><br> Pick up food
				from the current cell and go to the state st1, if there is no food
				in the current cell go to the state st2.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="command">Drop st </span><br> Drop food and go to
				the state st.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="command">Turn lr st </span><br> Turn to the
				direction lr and go to the state st. lr can be right or left.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="command">Move st1 st2</span><br> Move forward and
				go to the state st1, if the cell ahead is blocked go to the state
				st2.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="command">Flip p st1 st2 </span><br> Flip is used
				to make ant movement more random. A random number is generated
				between 0 to p-1, if the number generated is 0 the ant goes to the
				state st1, else to st2.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Creating and Saving an Ant Brain
				</h3>
				<p>
					An ant brain can be created using any text editing tool. If you are
					using Windows, you can use the default text editor Notepad to
					create an ant brain. <br> <br> To save the ant brain just
					save the text file. The ending format of the file does not matter,
					but for asthetic purposes you can change it to .brain <br>
					<br> In the extra folder provided with the simulator, there is
					an <span class="highlight">antBrain_language.xml </span> file,
					which you can import into NotePad++ text editor. This will aid you
					in creating an ant brain, instead of seeing just plain text, tokens
					are highlighted according to their category as shown below. <img
						src="img/tokens.jpg" id="logo">
				</p>

				<h4>
					Creating a Simple Ant Brain
					</h3>
					<p>Now, we know all the rules of making an ant brain and have
						all the tools, let's make one. We will make an ant brain which
						randomly walks around until it finds some food, then randomly
						walks until it reaches home to drop the food and repeats the
						whole process again.</p>
					<div class="list_c">
						<div class="list_a">
							0 &nbsp&nbspSense Ahead 1 3 Food<br> 1 &nbsp&nbspMove 2 0<br>
							2 &nbsp&nbspPickUp 8 0<br>
							<br> 3 &nbsp&nbspFlip 3 4 5<br> 4 &nbsp&nbspTurn Left 0<br>
							5 &nbsp&nbspFlip 2 6 7<br> 6 &nbsp&nbspTurn Right 0<br>
							7 &nbsp&nbspMove 0 3<br>
							<br> 8 &nbsp&nbspSense Ahead 9 11 Home<br> 9
							&nbsp&nbspMove 10 8<br> 10 &nbspDrop 0<br> 11 &nbspFlip
							3 12 13<br> 12 &nbspTurn Left 8<br> 13 &nbspFlip 2 14
							15<br> 14 &nbspTurn Right 8<br> 15 &nbspMove 8 11<br>
						</div>
						<div id="list_b">
							Let's walk through the ant brain given on the left: <br> <br>

							First, the ant checks if there is food ahead. If there is food,
							the ant goes to the state 1, else it goes to state 2. At state 1,
							the ant tries to move forward, if it can, it goes to the state 2,
							else it goes back to state 0. At state 2, the ant tries to pick
							up food, if succesful, the ant goes to state 8, else to
							state 0. <br> <br> States 3 to 7 are responsbile
							for randomly turning or moving forward the ant. State 3 flips, if
							the number generated is 0, the ant goes to state 4 where it
							turns to the left and goes to state 0. Else, the ant goes to
							state 5, where it flips again to move to the right. If both
							flips fail, the ant tries to move forward. If it cannot move
							forward, it goes back to state 3. <br> <br> States
							8 to 15 are responsible for getting the ant back to the anthill
							to drop the food. First, it checks if ahead of the ant is its
							home, if it is, the ant moves forward and drops the food. If the
							ant cannot move forward, it goes back to the state 8. If it does
							move forward, it drops the food, and goes to state 0. <br>
							<br> If ahead was not home, the ant goes to state 11.
							State 11 to 15 perform the same function as the states 3 to 7, just
							with different state numbers. <br> <br> In an abstract
							way, states 0 to 7 are responsible for randonly finding food, and
							once food is picked up the ant goes to the state 8. States 8 to
							15, randomly try to find the anthill to drop the food and go back
							to the state 0. <br> <br> Can you write a better
							antbrain?

					<h3>Creating a Map:</h3>

					<p>
						Just like the Ant Brain files, the map file has it's own syntax and rules. Systax of the
						map file as follows:
					</p>
					
					<div class="list">
						<ul>
							<li>The first line contains a single integer representing the size of the world in the x dimension.</li>
							<li>The second line contains a single integer representing the size of the world in the y dimension.</li>
							<li>The rest of the file consists of y lines, each containing x one-character cell specifiers, 
							separated by spaces (even lines also contain a leading space before the first cell specifier).
							The top-left cell specifier corresponds to position (0,0).</li>
							<li>The dimensions of the world are always 150 by 150 cells.</li>
							<li>The cells on the perimeter are always rocky.</li>
							<li>Every world contains exactly the same elements, of particular shapes: 2 anthills, 14 rocks, and 11 blobs of food. The anthills, in particular, are hexagons with sides of length 7. Also, a food blob is always a 5-by-5 rectangle, with each cell containing 5 food particles.</li>
						</ul>
						
					</div>
					
					<p>
						The possible cell specifiers are:<br><br>

						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp#&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        rocky cell<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        clear cell (containing nothing interesting)<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp+&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        red anthill cell<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        black anthill cell<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1 to 9&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   clear cell containing the given number of food particles<br>
					
					
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Hint: In the extra folder there is an XML file for the NotePad++
						Hint2: Just generate a random map.
